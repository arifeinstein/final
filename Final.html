<p>The development of baseball, formally known as America’s pastime, has completely transformed with the increase in the usage of baseball analytics. In recent years, teams would rely on scouting, personal recommendations from other coaches, and current performance in the Major Leagues to make decisions on their ball club. However, the development of technology and the ability to create player predictions using various formulas have completely changed how teams build their teams for success. Instead of looking at the basic player metrics such as batting average, home runs, and runs batted in, general managers can evaluate and make more accurate representations of athletes on their value based on more complicated analytics, for example,  on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and on-base plus slugging. These statistics include much more than just the basics, which fans should educate themselves on if they want to further their baseball knowledge, and the decision-making of their teams when they acquire or sign a new player.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent misunderstandings of fans in baseball is determining if players are good or bad solely based on the batting average. This is problematic as it paints an incomplete picture of a player’s offensive contributions. For example, batting average, the measurement which divides a player’s hits by at-bats, fails to consider many other elements regarding offensive production. This includes all hits, singles, doubles, triples, and home runs and doesn’t include power or extra base-hit ability. 
</p>

<p>According to Sweeny Murti, a long-time sports journalist who served as a New York Yankees beat reporter and talk show host at WFAN Radio, described the usage of batting average as incomplete. “Batting average can indicate a certain amount of luck, and all of the other advanced numbers are designed to try to take the luck out of them; batting average can be skewed. It doesn’t always tell you enough about the quality of the at-bats or hard hits”. From a broader point of view, when making determinations of a specific team and seeing if a team's combined batting average affects wins, it doesn’t.</p>

<div class="story-body2">
<p>Last year the New York Yankees won 99 games last year and reached the American League Conference Series. However, they had a combined .241 batting average as a team throughout the regular season. The Kansas City Royals ended the year with a team average of .244 but only won 65 games and ended the season with one of the worst records amongst teams in the Major Leagues. Based on this, it shows that batting average provides a limited scope on what offensive production is, so individuals must take that next step in understanding how baseball players should truly be based on their on-base percentage, slugging percent, and on-base plus slugging. </p>

<p>On-Base Percentage is integral in determining a player’s value as it considers every way a hitter could reach base, including hits, walks, and hit-by-pitches. This statistic was brought to light and made recognizable in the film Moneyball which told the story of the Oakland Athletics, who were the first to bring analytics into baseball. The team's goal was to replace three of their biggest stars, but with a low payroll and inability to do so,  General Manager Billy Beane had a different theory to bring winning back to Oakland. He looked for players with a high on-base percentage even when those with lower ones tended to have more power, were faster on the basepaths, and were better defensively. Furthermore, he encouraged these players to change their approach at the plate and focus more on getting walked, so the opposing pitcher was forced to throw strikes. In his first year using this theory, the Athletics went 103-59 and took first place in their division.</p>

<p>Since this remarkable feat, On-Base Percentage has only grown and has allowed teams to change the way they build their ballclubs because of it. Murti described this new way of structure as “looking for new ways to find productive players without using traditional statistics, using traditional statistics is what made players expensive, high batting average, home run guys, RBI guys, that is what made players more money, so they were looking for another way to put a good team on the field that didn’t cost as much.” Later, slugging percentage was quickly added into the mix, representing the number of bases a player records per at-bat. It measures all walks, singles, doubles, triples, home runs, and stolen bases and brings it down to one number. </p>

<div class="story-body2">
<p>This was the beginning of the shift in Major League Baseball that allowed teams to see that production isn’t solely based on batting average as it doesn’t consider various factors, including production with runners in scoring position, late-game pressure situations, or performance against different types of pitching. On-Base Percentage and Slugging, which considers all these factors, allows fans and evaluators to see how much more On-Base Plus Slugging as a team drives success than the batting average.</p>

<p>In 2022, the Los Angeles Dodgers won 111 games, producing an OPS of .775. The Pittsburgh Pirates had 65 wins with a .655 team OPS. This gives a lot more accurate representation of how teams produce throughout the regular season. The Dodgers produced more runs, walks, hits, and power during the season, allowing their OPS to soar into the high .700s. In comparison, the Pittsburgh Pirates struggled mightily to put balls in play, leading them to another losing year. When looking at the data for average compared to wins and on-base plus slugging compared to wins, OPS gives a much more concise representation of what fans should be looking at when evaluating teams and players. </p>

<p> Overall, the development of technology and the ability to create player predictions using various formulas have completely changed how teams build their teams for success. General managers can evaluate and make more accurate representations of athletes on their value based on more complicated analytics such as on-base plus slugging. This statistic includes much more than just the basics, which fans should continue to educate themselves on if they want to understand further their baseball knowledge. </p>
